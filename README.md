# IBM Advanced Data Science Capstone Project
## Weather Prediction based on Weather Data using Data Mining

The project represents the machine learning-based predictive analysis to predict the rainfall for the upcoming day based on the given data. The proposed system will help to predict the future trend of the weather considering the historical data. Through this model, the probability of the rainfall can be analyzed so that all the people can make their plans without any confusion.
